## Senior Seminar 2024-2025: MOSFET Fabrication

#### Background

A Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is a fundamental component used in digital and analog circuit applications. Modern smartphone processors contain an average of 15 billion transistors in them. MOSFETs control the voltage and current flow between contacts for electrical applications. By utilizing the electric field, MOSFETs rearrange electrons within the channel region of a semiconductor that allows a variable conductivity across two regions.

#### Design, Fabrication, and Characterization of a Field Effect Transistor

The MOSFET group is tasked with fabricating and characterizing MOSFETs to develop a concise, educational, and repeatable procedure for the future students of the ENGR 430 Semiconductor Devices class. This project will resemble the process, organization, execution and principles of the MOSFETs seen in the semiconductor industry. The scanning electron microscope, photolithography aligner, DC/RF sputter coater, thermal furnaces, and other equipment at the Fort Lewis College nanofabrication laboratory will be used to fabricate functional transistors. Optimal masks, channel type, and contact type will be determined by the team to begin characterization and the development of the MOSFET design process. The MOSFET design will also be modeled using industry-standard Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) software to ensure the repeatability and functionality of our process. Following the fabrication process, testing and characterization will be implemented to gain a full understanding of the functionality and yield of the devices. All team members should be thoroughly trained in all aspects of the design, fabrication, characterization, and testing procedures.
