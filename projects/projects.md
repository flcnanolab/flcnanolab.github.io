## Lung on a Chip

#### Background 

Recent advancements in biomedical research have greatly expanded our knowledge of disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. However, much of this progress has depended on animal models and conventional cell cultures, which often fail to accurately reflect human physiology. This discrepancy limits their ability to predict clinical outcomes. To address this gap, organ-on-a-chip technology has emerged as a promising alternative. These microengineered systems recreate the dynamic cellular environments of human organs, offering a more representative platform for studying disease pathology and drug responses.

#### Objectives 

The primary objective of this research is to develop a reliable fabrication method for producing thin, uniform porous silicon (PSi) membranes with controlled mechanical properties. These membranes are designed to simulate the interstitial barrier between lung epithelial and endothelial cells. By optimizing membrane characteristics such as thickness, porosity, and strength, we aim to support the creation of more physiologically accurate Lung-on-a-Chip models.

#### Applications 

The fabricated PSi membranes are intended for integration into Lung-on-a-Chip systems. These models can be used to study lung diseases and develop personalized therapies with higher predictive value than traditional methods. Ultimately, this research contributes to the advancement of precision medicine and the reduction of reliance on animal testing in biomedical research.

## Superconductivity and Quantum Levitation

#### Background

Superconductivity was first discovered in 1911 by a Dutch physicist named Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. Using liquid helium, he learned that some materials completely lose their electrical resistivity when near absolute zero Kelvin. In other words, current can flow through superconductors perfectly with no energy loss. Since then, many advancements in superconductor materials have been made. Instead of requiring liquid helium, modern High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) can be cooled with liquid nitrogen, a much more affordable and available material. This makes the use and demonstration of superconductors far simpler and possible in less extreme environments.

#### Applications

Because superconductors have infinite conductance, current will flow through them without any voltage generation. This characteristic is shown by a machine called a Mr. SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device). With an oscilloscope, the zero resistance quality and other quantum mechanical effects can be seen using the Mr. SQUID's superconducting Josephson Junctions. 

Another device that shows a quantum mechanical interaction is the Magnetic Levitation kit. Because of the Meissner effect, a superconducting disc is able to levitate above magnets when perfectly opposing eddy curents are generated from the cuperconductor being exposed to a magnetic field. In other words, the magnetic flux is ejected from the superconductor, and the resulting force is enough to counteract the weight of the disc. Many modern High Temperature Superconductors (HTS's) also exhibit flux pinning, where magnetic flux is vorticized and locked holding the disc with even more force. Flux pinning allows superconductors to withstand even higher magnetic field and levitate far more than their own weight.

#### Future Uses

Because of their efficiency, superconductors may be used in future power grid systems to greatly reduce the losses in power transfer. They could also be used in transportation or mechanical systems as levitation bearing, or in fusion power generation because of their ability to generate huge compressive magnetic fields. Luckily, higher temperature superconductive materials are discovered continuously which further reduce the cooling issues that serve as the main issue in their application. Soon, we may see superconductor technology in everyday technology.

## Senior Seminar 2024-2025: MOSFET Fabrication

#### Background

A Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is a fundamental component used in digital and analog circuit applications. Modern smartphone processors contain an average of 15 billion transistors in them. MOSFETs control the voltage and current flow between contacts for electrical applications. By utilizing the electric field, MOSFETs rearrange electrons within the channel region of a semiconductor that allows a variable conductivity across two regions.

#### Objectives

The objective of this project is to fabricate and characterize functional Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) while developing a reliable, repeatable procedure that can be used by future students in the ENGR 430 Semiconductor Devices course. The team aims to determine the optimal type of MOSFET, select appropriate photolithography masks, and choose the best contact materials based on electrical performance and fabrication feasibility. A key part of the project involves modeling the fabrication process using Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) software to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. The devices will be evaluated through electrical testing and microscopy to validate their performance against commercial standards and assess yield across the wafer.

#### Applications 

The MOSFETs developed through this project will serve as educational tools for future students learning semiconductor device fabrication. Beyond instructional use, the project mimics industry-standard procedures and offers insight into real-world manufacturing challenges and solutions. The skills and knowledge gained can be applied to prototype integrated circuits, support low-cost research in device physics, and inform future projects involving more advanced or specialized transistor designs.
