## Lung on a Chip

#### Background 

Recent advancements in biomedical research have greatly expanded our knowledge of disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. However, much of this progress has depended on animal models and conventional cell cultures, which often fail to accurately reflect human physiology. This discrepancy limits their ability to predict clinical outcomes. To address this gap, organ-on-a-chip technology has emerged as a promising alternative. These microengineered systems recreate the dynamic cellular environments of human organs, offering a more representative platform for studying disease pathology and drug responses.

#### Objectives 

The primary objective of this research is to develop a reliable fabrication method for producing thin, uniform porous silicon (PSi) membranes with controlled mechanical properties. These membranes are designed to simulate the interstitial barrier between lung epithelial and endothelial cells. By optimizing membrane characteristics such as thickness, porosity, and strength, we aim to support the creation of more physiologically accurate Lung-on-a-Chip models.

#### Applications 

The fabricated PSi membranes are intended for integration into Lung-on-a-Chip systems. These models can be used to study lung diseases and develop personalized therapies with higher predictive value than traditional methods. Ultimately, this research contributes to the advancement of precision medicine and the reduction of reliance on animal testing in biomedical research.

## Senior Seminar 2024-2025: MOSFET Fabrication

#### Background

A Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is a fundamental component used in digital and analog circuit applications. Modern smartphone processors contain an average of 15 billion transistors in them. MOSFETs control the voltage and current flow between contacts for electrical applications. By utilizing the electric field, MOSFETs rearrange electrons within the channel region of a semiconductor that allows a variable conductivity across two regions.

#### Design, Fabrication, and Characterization of a Field Effect Transistor

The MOSFET group is tasked with fabricating and characterizing MOSFETs to develop a concise, educational, and repeatable procedure for the future students of the ENGR 430 Semiconductor Devices class. This project will resemble the process, organization, execution and principles of the MOSFETs seen in the semiconductor industry. The scanning electron microscope, photolithography aligner, DC/RF sputter coater, thermal furnaces, and other equipment at the Fort Lewis College nanofabrication laboratory will be used to fabricate functional transistors. Optimal masks, channel type, and contact type will be determined by the team to begin characterization and the development of the MOSFET design process. The MOSFET design will also be modeled using industry-standard Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) software to ensure the repeatability and functionality of our process. Following the fabrication process, testing and characterization will be implemented to gain a full understanding of the functionality and yield of the devices. All team members should be thoroughly trained in all aspects of the design, fabrication, characterization, and testing procedures.
