## Lung on a Chip

#### Background 

Recent advancements in biomedical research have greatly expanded our knowledge of disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. However, much of this progress has depended on animal models and conventional cell cultures, which often fail to accurately reflect human physiology. This discrepancy limits their ability to predict clinical outcomes. To address this gap, organ-on-a-chip technology has emerged as a promising alternative. These microengineered systems recreate the dynamic cellular environments of human organs, offering a more representative platform for studying disease pathology and drug responses.

#### Objectives 

The primary objective of this research is to develop a reliable fabrication method for producing thin, uniform porous silicon (PSi) membranes with controlled mechanical properties. These membranes are designed to simulate the interstitial barrier between lung epithelial and endothelial cells. By optimizing membrane characteristics such as thickness, porosity, and strength, we aim to support the creation of more physiologically accurate Lung-on-a-Chip models.

#### Applications 

The fabricated PSi membranes are intended for integration into Lung-on-a-Chip systems. These models can be used to study lung diseases and develop personalized therapies with higher predictive value than traditional methods. Ultimately, this research contributes to the advancement of precision medicine and the reduction of reliance on animal testing in biomedical research.

## Senior Seminar 2024-2025: MOSFET Fabrication

#### Background

A Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is a fundamental component used in digital and analog circuit applications. Modern smartphone processors contain an average of 15 billion transistors in them. MOSFETs control the voltage and current flow between contacts for electrical applications. By utilizing the electric field, MOSFETs rearrange electrons within the channel region of a semiconductor that allows a variable conductivity across two regions.

#### Objectives

The objective of this project is to fabricate and characterize functional Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) while developing a reliable, repeatable procedure that can be used by future students in the ENGR 430 Semiconductor Devices course. The team aims to determine the optimal type of MOSFET, select appropriate photolithography masks, and choose the best contact materials based on electrical performance and fabrication feasibility. A key part of the project involves modeling the fabrication process using Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) software to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. The devices will be evaluated through electrical testing and microscopy to validate their performance against commercial standards and assess yield across the wafer.

#### Applications 

The MOSFETs developed through this project will serve as educational tools for future students learning semiconductor device fabrication. Beyond instructional use, the project mimics industry-standard procedures and offers insight into real-world manufacturing challenges and solutions. The skills and knowledge gained can be applied to prototype integrated circuits, support low-cost research in device physics, and inform future projects involving more advanced or specialized transistor designs.
