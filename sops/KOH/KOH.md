## ⚠️ Safety Guidelines
Safety in the NanoLab is extremely important. Following these guidelines will help ensure a safe and productive environment for all individuals. Blatant disregard of the safety guidelines will result in expulsion from the laboratory. 

- No eating or drinking in the lab.
- Wear nitrile gloves and a bunny suit.
- Wear safety goggles when handling chemicals and solvents.
- Do not wear open-toed shoes or shorts.
- If you have shorts on, wear scrubs over them.
- Wear a hair net and tie back long hair.
- Wear a beard net for long facial hair.
- Read the safety data sheet (SDS) of chemicals before you handle them.
- Be cautious of broken wafer pieces, as they can easily cut your skin.
- Handle and mix chemicals in a fume hood to avoid inhalation.
- Dispose of chemicals in designated containers; do not pour down the drain. 

Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) is a highly corrosive base that can cause severe damage to the skin in case of contact. Stay alert! Carelessness is extremely dangerous.  

In case of skin contact: 
- Rinse it immediately with plenty of water for at least 5 minutes.
- It may cause burns, irritation or allergic reactions like hives, rashes, and difficulty breathing.
- If burns, irritation, or allergic reactions occur, contact your advisor first, then seek medical attention. 

In case of eye contact: 
- Wear goggles! This should not happen if you follow the guidelines of the lab.
- Rinse eyes immediately in the eye wash station for at least 15 minutes.
- Contact your advisor promptly.

## Important Notes Prior to Procedure 

- The KOH process is expected to take 4 to 5 hours from start to finish.
- The KOH process should be done with a partner who is familiar with the procedure for added safety and guidance.
- Adhere to safety standards; avoid shortcuts.
- Plan for 2 to 3 hours of downtime while the wafer is being etched. Consider bringing work or other tasks to occupy your time.
- Every member participating in the KOH should have their clean room notebook ready to take notes.

## Preparing the KOH Setup 

- Check the deionized (DI) water filter; water quality should read >15 MΩ.
- Set up notes in your cleanroom notebook (_Figure 1_) and include the following:
  - People (who are participating in helping with this etch)
  - Weight of each boat (6 total)
  - Total KOH and DI water inside the KOH solution
  - Temperatures of KOH bath and Iso bath
  - Wafer specifications including resistivity, thickness, type of silicon wafer (ex: DSP (100) P/Boron), and wafer pack lot number
  - Hot plate settings
  - Date/sample ID
  - Desired thickness
  - Sample thickness pre-etch and after 1 hour of etching
  - Notes on any variables that could potentially affect the results
    - **No changes are trivial!**

- Use a clean wafer. If none are available, refer to the wafer cleaning SOP.
  - Wafer MUST be p-type, DSP and (100) oriented 
- Use only the glassware you know is clean. 
  - If unsure, clean all glassware before use. (_Refer to the cleanup process section._)
- Use a wide 1000 mL beaker to transfer 1100 mL of DI water into a clean 2000 mL beaker (_Figure 3_). This is your ISO bath.
  - When using DI water for the first time in an hour, let the tap run for 15–30 seconds to flush out any potential contaminants.

  <p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Stir bars </p>
</div>

- Place the 2000 mL ISO bath beaker on the large primary hotplate (_Figure 5_). 
  - Ensure it is centered on the hot plate.
  - Orient the beaker with the mouth/spout on the right side.
  - Double-check that the beaker is properly centered before turning on the hot plate.
- Turn on the hot plate and set it to 400 °C and 175 rpm.
- Measure 600 mL of DI water using the 1000 mL graduated cylinder and pour it into a clean spoutless, tall, 1000 mL beaker. This will be your KOH beaker (_Figure 6_).
  - Use the wide 1000 mL beaker again to transfer DI water from the tap.
  - Ensure to check the meniscus correctly.

- Put a small clean stir bar in the KOH beaker (_Figure 4_).
- Put the KOH beaker on the smaller secondary hotplate (_Figure 6_).
  - The stir settings on this hotplate are used to speed up the mixing process.
  - Never turn on the heat while the KOH beaker is on this hotplate.
- The setup should look like this:

## **Preparing the KOH**
### **_Measuring KOH_**

- Get 12 small weigh boats and a 400 mL beaker (_Figure 7_).

 <div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flcnanolab/flcnanolab.github.io/main/ImagesForWeb/KOHsop/Picture7.jpg" width="400"/>
  <p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> 400 mL KOH scooping beaker </p>
</div>

- You will be measuring 600 ± .01 grams of KOH pellets into 6 pairs of weigh boats (roughly 100 grams in each).
- Place the KOH bucket next to you and scoop the pellets with the 400 mL beaker (_Figure 7_).
  - The pellets should only be scooped with the KOH beaker.
  - Twist the bag and close the bucket immediately after every scoop.
- Turn the scale on (_Figure 8_).
  - The scale should be calibrated every 1-2 weeks.
  - Check the bubble balance every time you use the scale.
  - The bubble balance is calibrated specifically to its location. DO NOT move it.
  - Don’t let anyone use the table when you are using the scale. Any motion can mess up the balance of the scale.
  - WEAR GOGGLES!
- Place one weigh boat on the scale and tare the scale. 

 <div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flcnanolab/flcnanolab.github.io/main/ImagesForWeb/KOHsop/Picture8.jpg" width="400"/>
  <p><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Scale </p>
</div>

- Once the scale reads 0.0000 g, slowly pour KOH pellets from the beaker into the weigh boat until the weight is ~100 g.
- Record the exact weight with a sequentially assigned boat number (e.g., the first boat is #1, the second is #2, etc.).
- After filling each boat (_Figure 9_):
  - Label a second empty boat with the same number and use it as a cover.
  - Tape the two boats together securely.
  - Place the sealed boats in the fume hood.

 <div align="center">

  <p><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Sealed boats with labels (when boats are not in the hood place on a clean room wipe) </p>
</div>

- Press 0 to get rid of the weight of the boat that is showing on the scale and then you can proceed to the next one.
  - This should be repeated 5 times until you have 600 ± .01 grams of KOH.
  - On the last boat, you should subtract the 5 boats you have already measured from 600 to find the exact amount you need.
  - Record the actual amount of KOH in the last boat in your notebook
- Once you are done measuring KOH, make sure you tape the bag closed with no air inside and completely seal the bucket.
- Clean the scale with DI water and a Kimwipe after measuring the KOH.

### **_Mixing KOH_**

- Set a cleanroom wipe in front of the hot plate that has the KOH beaker.
- Grab a thermometer, glass stir rod, and timer.
- Set spin speed to 5.
- Slowly add half of the first boat inside the KOH beaker and simultaneously start the timer.
  - It is an exothermic reaction so it will get hot.
  - If you spill any of the pellets, DO NOT put them back in the KOH beaker.
  - If any KOH pellets are spilled:
    - Collect the spilled pieces in a new weigh boat.
    - Measure the spilled pieces on the scale excluding the weight of the boat.
    - Throw those spilled pieces into hazardous waste in a cleanroom wipe.
    - Measure the same weight of KOH that is spilled from the KOH bucket and add that to the KOH as well.
- Stir solution with a glass stir rod to help the KOH dissolve faster.
  - This should be done while the stir bar is also oscillating. 
  - Be very careful and ensure the stir rod never contacts the stir bar.
  - Manually mix until all pellets dissolve.
    - If the solution is cloudy, it means that the KOH is still dissolving.
- Add half a boat (~50 g of KOH) every 2 minutes.
  - Check temperature with a thermometer frequently to ensure solution stays below 90°C.
  - If the solution is not clear or the temperature is >85°C, lower the hood and wait another 1-2 minutes before adding more KOH. 
---
## **Setup after KOH is ready**

- Suspend the KOH solution into the ISO bath using the Teflon-wrapped white beaker ring.
  - Pick up this beaker from the top; the body of the beaker will be way too hot to touch.
- Place a thermometer in the ISO bath and KOH solution (_Figure 10_). Make sure both the thermometers are at the same level.

 <div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flcnanolab/flcnanolab.github.io/main/ImagesForWeb/KOHsop/Picture10.jpg" width="400"/>
  <p><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Thermometers </p>
</div>

- Grab the wide 1000 mL beaker (_Figure 3_) and fill it with ~800 mL of DI water. Set on the small hotplate and turn on the heat to 7.
  - DI water needs to be heated to ~90℃ throughout the etching process to refill the ISO bath.
  - The DI water level in the ISO bath must be above the KOH level during the entire etch.
  - **DO NOT ADD WATER TO KOH BATH DURING ETCH**
  - Now you wait until KOH reaches 90℃.
---
## **Preparing the sample**

- Measure the thickness of the wafer in the 5 designated spots (_Figure 11_) using a micrometer while you wait for the KOH solution to reach the desired temperature.

 <div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flcnanolab/flcnanolab.github.io/main/ImagesForWeb/KOHsop/Picture11.png" width="400"/>
  <p><strong>Figure 11:</strong> 5 designated measuring spots and their assigned letters </p>
</div>

  - Clean micrometer hammers with IPA before and after each use.
  - Zero the micrometer before measuring the wafer in the micrometer stand (_Figure 12_).
  - Note the 5 thickness measurements in your notebook with their respective location.

 <div align="center">

  <p><strong>Figure 12:</strong> Micrometer in 3D printed stand </p>
</div>

- Now you are going to sandwich the wafer inside of the hard Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cell using expanded PTFE (ePTFE) gaskets to create a seal and avoid damaging the sample.

 <div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flcnanolab/flcnanolab.github.io/main/ImagesForWeb/KOHsop/Picture13.png" width="400"/>
  <p><strong>Figure 13:</strong> KOH sample cell  </p>
</div>

- Hard PTFE circular pieces have engraved letters to differentiate the two pieces; one side is A and the other is B _Figure 13c_).
  - The side marked with “A” is the side with the nuts.
  - The side marked with “B” is the side with the bolts.
  - Notice these are not visible in the image below. These should be on the outside and visible after the wafer is sealed inside cell. 
- The wafer needs to be placed into the holder in a specific way shown below (_Figure 14_):
  - Insert bolts on side B and lay both pieces of the cell down with the A and B labeled sides face down.
  - Place the ePTFE gaskets (_Figure 13b_) inside the cell, one on each side.
  - Align the primary flat with the notched-out bit at the top of the cell (_Figure 14_).
  - Close the cell by placing side A on side B and secure it with nuts (_Figure 14_). 
    - Screw in pairs of nuts on opposite sides to avoid applying uneven pressure to the wafer.
  - Attach the holder arm (_Figure 13a_).
