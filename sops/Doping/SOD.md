# Spin on Dopant (SOD) Process Guide

---

### ⚠️ Safety Notice
- **Certified BOE user required**
- **Wear goggles and proper PPE.**

---
## Materials
Dopant: Filmtronics B153  
Wafers:  
- 1 n-type 3-9 ohm cm for Spin on Dopant (SOD) control
- All wafers ready for processing
  
### Setup
1. Spin coater
    1. Ensure that both the pump and coater are plugged in and switches are turned on
    2. Turn valve that connects Nitrogen to coater OFF
    3. Turn ON Nitrogen adjust psi to 35 (don’t want too much pressure)
    4. Turn valve to ON position
    5. Turn ON coater, then adjust psi until it turns on (normally ~40 psi)
    6. Settings: 
        1. Acceleration time: 12 sec
        2. Speed time: 20 sec
        3. Spin speed: 3000 RPM
        4. Decel Time: 0.5s
2. Hot plate
    1. 200°C
    2. 12 min
### Procedure
1. Place clean N-type wafer on chuck
2. Use black alignment tool to center wafer
3. Do a practice run, wafer should have minimal “wobble”.
4. Get dopant ready
    1. Fill vial as much as possible
    2. Will dispense full dropper
5. Dispense dopant in center of wafer and IMMEDIATELY close door and start spinning.
    1. If the dopant sits on wafer it will create a line after the soft bake
6. After spin is complete, transfer wafer to hot plate
    1. ~200° for 12min (10-15min is recommended)
### Drive-in Procedure
Tube furnace: Ramp up and down same as Oxidation settings, just have to change the soak 
temperature and the running time from preceding/following temperatures. I’ve highlighted 
in blue what changed from oxidation.

- Turn **Main Power** switch to ON.
- Press <img src="Images/4.png" width="30"/> to display `C01` (current setting).
- This button, <img src="Images/5.png" width="30"/> will be used to go and see the next step of the heating curve.
- When adjusting the times, these buttons are used to change values up and down,  <img src="Images/6.png" width="30"/>  <img src="Images/7.png" width="30"/>. To change certain values, use this button, <img src="Images/4.png" width="30"/> , to switch to different digits.
- Change t06 from 400 to 1 by using the buttons shown in steps above. This tells the controller to take one minute to go to the next step of the heating curve.
