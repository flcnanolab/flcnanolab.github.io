## Notes

This SOP outlines the standardized cleaning procedures for polished / lapped silicon wafers. The cleaning process is essential for removing organic and inorganic contaminants from the wafer surface. The cleaning process is crucial for ensuring the quality of the subsequent process steps, such as lithography, etching, and deposition.

## Preparation

1. Fill 3 600-mL beakers, one with acetone, one with IPA, and one with methanol. Fill beakers with enough solvent to cover the wafers completely.

## Acetone Cleaning

1. Place the wafer in the acetone beaker.
2. Sonicate the wafer for 10 minutes.

## Isopropanol (IPA) Cleaning

1. Remove the wafer holder/boat from the acetone beaker.
2. Rinse the wafer holder/boat thoroughly with IPA.
3. Place the wafer in the IPA beaker.
4. Sonicate the wafer for 10 minutes.

## Methanol Cleaning

1. Remove the wafer holder/boat from the IPA beaker.
2. Rinse the wafer holder/boat thoroughly with methanol.
3. Place the wafer in the methanol beaker.
4. Sonicate the wafer for 10 minutes.

## Drying

1. Remove the wafer holder/boat from the methanol beaker.
2. Rinse the wafer holder/boat thoroughly with DI water.
3. Dry the wafer with an N2 gun.

## Wafer Storage

1. Store the wafer in a clean, dry wafer holder.
